NTF ROBOTS for ZILLIQA ON GITCOIN

This project is a procedural generator of unique NFT robots for creating NFT collection.
On the html page, a zil bot image is randomly generated. Each zil bot has its own seed - a unique id. ID - in fact, the numbers of variants of the parts of the robot in order.
Id is also represented in hex form for abbreviation.
So any bot has a unique hex id. (But not every hex number has its own bot)
Total robots can be 1,000,000
There are rare and super rare bots
